# Next level of reproducible, comparable and integrable Metabolomics (RCI-M)

The [ELIXIR Metabolomics Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/metabolomics) relies on standards, formats and data treatment solutions development and adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring high-quality reported metadata, sufficiently contextualised results, interoperable and reusable datasets and integrating these metabolomics data with other omics or other studies. The present project is designed to address these issues, and aims to connect key international standards with [ELIXIR resources](https://elixir-europe.org/services/list) as well as creating associated community guidelines and training materials. 

Based on the [FAIRification framework](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/introduction/fairification-process.html), project workpackages will:
> Increase interoperability and re-use of public metabolomics datasets and workflows through enhanced and extended open data standards, resources and new semantic annotations;

> Define, ensure and establish quality control for study baselines in Metabolomics and Exposomics;

> Facilitate metabolomic data interpretation and meta-analysis integration with multi-omics and systems biology studies. 

As a first necessary step, the project will create a `Semantic Metabolomics Data Model` to standardise metadata, ensuring unambiguous reuse of metabolomics projects. This model will focus on integrating key ontologies, providing open training initiatives, and enhancing the interoperability of metabolomics data through the production of open guidelines for annotation steps. By linking with [ELIXIR’s Deposition Databases](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases), [ISA Framework](https://isa-tools.org/index.html), and other services, the current project seeks to boost interconnexion with [ELIXIR platforms](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms), other ELIXIR communities ([System Biology](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/systems-biology), [Food & Nutrition](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/food-and-nutrition), [Galaxy](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy), [Proteomics](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/proteomics), [Toxicology](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/toxicology), [RDA](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/research-data-management)and [Single-Cell Omics](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/single-cell-omics)), the [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html) and [BioSchemas.org](https://bioschemas.org/) communities. 

Project outcomes are expected to promote the emergence of ambitious and innovative semantic-based solutions for inter-comparison of studies in healthcare, clinical and plant domains.

The RCI-M project is one of 12 projects funded by the [**ELIXIR Science Tier Open Call 2024**](https://elixir-europe.org/news/science-open-calls-2024) to support ELIXIR's scientific strategy and connect ELIXIR’s expert groups across location (Nodes), research domain (Communities) and technical area (Platforms). RCI-M is now part of the [Cellular and molecular research](https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/science/cellular-molecular-research)Commissioned Service roadmap.
